            <p>My name is Alan. I was born in Richmond, Virginia. The reason I decided to apply to take a web developement class, has to do with my childhood. I loved playing video games. My dad used to say " You love these things, you should grow up and learn how to build them." And that is where it has originated from. It took me a little while to get here though. I have work in a lot of different fields. For instance, most recently I worked in the property management industry for 10 years. I learned a great deal about how to fix everything that you see in todays apartment living. I am excited to say that I am ready to move on and get into what I have been dreaming about since I was a kid.  </p>
